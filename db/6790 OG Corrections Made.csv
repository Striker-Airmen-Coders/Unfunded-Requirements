The annual Desktop All Access Subscription provides a license for the PCoIP (PC over IP) Management Console Enterprise.  The license for this console expires each year and disables the console.  This console is used to manage the 750 Zero client devices on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  Specifically the subscription provides access to the latest firmware updates for the Zero Client devices. These updates close security vulnerabilities and provide feature updates needed to operate the virtual desktop environment.  When new SIPRNET tokens are introduced, some are not compatible with the current firmware release. This breaks SIPRNET capability for users that have received new tokens until the firmware for the Zero Client device has been updated to provide compatibility.  The Enterprise Console allows 2 CS to push the updates to all online Zero clients quickly. Without the console, each Zero Client device would have to be manually updated, taking hundreds of staffing hours.

Since the change in licensing, 2 CS/SCOO has been tracking the number of named users who have been using the Virtual Environment in order to ensure that we are complying with the licensing agreement. In May and October there were exercises that involved different groups of personnel who could be considered surge support.","If the additional licenses are not purchased, the government could be found in violation of our enterprise licensing agreement with VMware.

PA equipment requires update every five years per AFI 35-109 para 5.2.1 to maintain technological currency. The Air Force Public Affairs Agency maintains standard equipment lists for each UTC type that satisfies the LOGDET. These standards equipment lists update approximately every three years. Therefore, a five-year replacement cycle for UTCs is justified to maintain technological currency. 2 BW/PA has 15 UTCs positions with an average equipment cost between the two types of standard equipment kits of $19,000. Replacing 3 UTCs per year will cost approximately $57,000. Additionally, as the AFGSC Tier II production facility, PA is required to maintain studio production capability above a standard base PA capability. The annual refresh cost of this equipment averages $20,000 due to the cost of 4k professional video production cameras. Historically, PA has been inadequately funded resulting in relatively large unfunded requests every year to mitigate the shortfall. The unfunded just for last year was excess of 850% of the annual PA budget. This new amount builds an adequate, but not excessive, funding for PA equipment in accordance with AFI.
